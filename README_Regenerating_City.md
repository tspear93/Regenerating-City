# 🌍 Regenerating City

**Born from the Auditor’s Era — Guided by the Nature Boy and the Man in the Mirror**

A live, interactive civic framework where empathy, data, and architecture merge.  
This project visualizes how cities could *breathe, adapt, and regenerate* through transparency, education, and balance.

---

## 🧭 Overview

**Regenerating City** is an experimental public interface that blends:
- Data visualization of civic “life metrics”
- Interactive feedback systems for transparency
- Visual and philosophical storytelling

Every department, every action, and every reflection contributes to a single living metric:

```
Balance = (Life + Reflection - Decay) / Awareness
```
